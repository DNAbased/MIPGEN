{"name":"MIPgen","tagline":"One stop MIP design and analysis","body":"Welcome.\r\n\r\nMIPgen is a fast, simple way to generate designs for MIP assays targeting hundreds or thousands of genomic loci in parallel.\r\n\r\nPackaged with MIPgen are scripts that aid in visualization of MIP designs and processing of MIP sequence reads to SAM files that can then be passed through any standard variant calling pipeline.\r\n\r\nMIPgen is provided freely for non-commercial use.
